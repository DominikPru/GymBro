A simple fitness app for creating a workout plan.

You can find a manual for each tab in the app on login.

Feel free to clone and run the app, just add a connection string to a mongodb database, and change your db name.

If you want to see the app in action, visit: https://exercisedemo.onrender.com/

Also, cats are objectively cuter than dogs... I just wanted you to know.
